# Predictive and Preventive Maintenance System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent predictive and preventive maintenance system for industrial machines. The system will use AI models, real-time alerts, and interactive guides to optimize maintenance operations.

## 🔥 Key Features
- **AI-powered anomaly detection**: Predict potential failures before they happen.
- **Real-time alerts & notifications**: Inform technicians of issues via web, email, or SMS.
- **Interactive repair guides**: Step-by-step assistance for workers.
- **CrewAI Agents**:
  - **Prediction Agent**: Forecasts failures.
  - **Alerting Agent**: Sends notifications.
  - **Guidance Agent**: Provides repair instructions.
  - **Coordination Agent**: Manages agent communication.
- **Web Application (React.js)**: User-friendly dashboard for monitoring and interaction.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 1️⃣ Accessing Project Files
Since you don't have Git, use Google Drive for file storage and collaboration:
- **Create a shared folder in Google Drive** and upload all project files.
- **Use Google Colab** to run AI models directly from Drive.

### 2️⃣ Setting Up Google Colab
- Open Google Colab and create a new notebook.
- Mount Google Drive with:
  ```python
  from google.colab import drive
  drive.mount('/content/drive')
  ```
- Access datasets stored in Drive for processing.

### 3️⃣ Running AI Models on Google Colab
- Install dependencies:
  ```python
  !pip install crewai flask fastapi numpy pandas
  ```
- Load and preprocess data from Google Drive.

### 4️⃣ Web Application Setup (React.js)
- Develop frontend locally and store in Google Drive.
- Use Flask/FastAPI backend to connect CrewAI agents.
